(This project is an educational project for the course I took on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-5c99d673-39a2-4bbe-846f-934141affd15/)

Smartbrain project lets you type in a link to photos of human faces, and use Machine learning API from CLARAFAI to detect and point to 
detected human faces. Your count will increase for every photo you submit.

This project is the front-end software for smartbrain project (https://github.com/vincejhan98/smartbrain) 
API-keys are customizable in the backend. Clarafai API's access code is hidden in backend for security purposes.
